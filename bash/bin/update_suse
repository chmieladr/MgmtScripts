# Script by Adrian Chmiel (chmieladr)

# This script is mainly adjusted to openSUSE Leap distro and assumes that:
# - you mainly use the Zypper package manager
# - you have the Flatpak package manager installed

# Refresh repositories
sudo zypper refresh

# Upgrade distribution based only on official repositories (some might be invalid)
sudo zypper dist-upgrade --from openSUSE:repo-oss --from openSUSE:repo-non-oss --from repo-update --from repo-update-non-oss --from openSUSE:update-oss --from openSUSE:update-sle --from openSUSE:update-backports --no-allow-vendor-change --auto-agree-with-licenses -y

# Update all of the other packages
sudo zypper update -y

# Repositories-based update confirmation message
echo "System and its repositories have been refreshed and updated!"

# Flatpak updates
sudo flatpak update -y
# Seperately force update of system runtimes
sudo flatpak update --subpath=/runtime -y

# Flatpak-based update confirmation message
if [ !#? ] ; then
	echo "Flatpak packages have been successfully updated!"
fi

# Snap updates
sudo snap refresh

# Snap-based update confirmation message
if [ !#? ] ; then
	echo "Snap packages have been successfully refreshed!"
fi
